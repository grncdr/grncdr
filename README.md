### Hi

I'm Stephen, a full-stack-ish developer working at a company called [Dropscan](https://www.dropscan.de). I do a lot of React & Typescript, as well as Rails, infrastructure and whatever else needs to be done.

Most of my open-source projects are pretty much unmaintained though I do try to check issues ~monthly. E-mail me if you really need my attention.
